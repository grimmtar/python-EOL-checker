# python-EOL-checker
A Bash tool that checks for what components, files, processes, and virtual environments on your system are currently dependent on End-of-Life (EOL) Python versions, including Python 2.x and 3.x versions < 3.6. This tool helps identify outdated dependencies that may pose security risks or require migration.
